If you've been following me on Facebook, you might recall I enthusiastically announced my upcoming trip to Japan. So what now? Where are sushi and temple photos? What happened to Harajuku street fashion shots and embarassing Karaoke clips? Truth is, I got an opportunity to embark on an even greater Adventure, possibly a life-changing one.

After a 3-month course of Web Development, I hesitantly applied (as in, my fingers trembled when I hit the Submit button)  for a junior developer position in a company making WordPress themes, which I think was quite a career-changer.

Even though Iâ€™m not quite there yet in the coding department (my job is mainly to support our customers with technical issues and perform an occasional customization job), I think this opportunity, being surround by a small, yet knowledgeable team of web experts, has given my humble attempt, taking that first web dev course, a firmer ground to continue with my aspiration to become a web developer.

And that, I think is a giant leap forward into a wonderful adventure of killing bugs, wrangling with untamed creatures (hello, Python!), getting to know new cultures (geeks) and narrowing my horizons within tight viewports of desktops, tablets and mobile phones. Plus, Japan is huge on game development ðŸ˜›

Have any of you gone through a career change? Has there been a particular moment or a person whom you attribute significant role in the switch? Feel free to share your stories or any thoughts on the subject in the comments. Thank you!
